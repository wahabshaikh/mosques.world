# Steward a PR

1. **Look at the whole PR**: merge state, CI on the latest commit, every unresolved review thread.
2. **Conflicts**: merge `main` into the branch (no rebase or force-push on someone else's branch).
   Regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `pnpm install`, never by hand. If two migrations now share a
   number, renumber **the PR's** migration, never the one on `main`.
3. **Red CI**: CI runs `pnpm lint`, `tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test:coverage`, `vinext build` (see
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Reproduce the failing step locally with the same command first, then fix
   the cause and show the same command passing. A coverage failure means missing tests. There are no
   known-flaky unit tests: treat every failure as real.
4. **Review comments**: implement small, local asks; reply with a proposal on larger design asks.
   Resolve threads you addressed.
5. **Before each push** run the `preflight` skill. One validated push beats several speculative ones.
6. Never skip, `.only`, or weaken a test, lower coverage thresholds, or disable a lint rule to get green.
